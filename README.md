# Data Scraping Goodreads using Python BeautifulSoup

I was inspired to embark on this project as I realised all of the data that I was working on was extracted either from Kaggle or some database website. Hence, I wanted to broaden my understanding in data gathering and the ways to extract data from a website.

I was following closely on the tutorial hosted by [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim). The code to generate the top crytocurrency coins and GPU prices on an e-commerce platform was provided during the tutorial. This is a disclaimer that those codes were not written by me but serves as a reference point for myself when writing the code to scrape the reviews from goodreads website.

You can find the code to scrap data from the various websites here:

2. [goodreads_production](https://github.com/tjiacheng123/Webscraping_book_reviews/blob/main/webscrape_goodreads.py)
